    r"""Generator of labels and sequences from a fasta file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    infile : open file object or str
        An open fasta file or a path to a fasta file.
    strict : bool
        If ``True`` a ``ValueError`` will be raised if there is a fasta label
        line with no associated sequence, or a sequence with no associated
        label line (in other words, if there is a partial record). If
        ``False``, partial records will be skipped.
    label_to_name : function
        A function to apply to the sequence label (i.e., text on the header
        line) before yielding it. By default, the sequence label is returned
        with no processing. This function must take a single string as input
        and return a single string as output.
    finder : function
        The function to apply to find records in the fasta file. In general
        you should not have to change this.
    label_characters : str
        String used to indicate the beginning of a new record. In general you
        should not have to change this.
    ignore_comment : bool
        If `True`, split the sequence label on spaces, and return the label
        only as the first space separated field (i.e., the sequence
        identifier). Note: if both ``ignore_comment`` and ``label_to_name`` are
        passed, ``ignore_comment`` is ignored (both operate on the label, so
        there is potential for things to get messy otherwise).

    Returns
    -------
    two-item tuple of str
        yields the label and sequence for each entry.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``strict == True``, raises a ``ValueError`` if there is a fasta
        label line with no associated sequence, or a sequence with no
        associated label line (in other words, if there is a partial record).
